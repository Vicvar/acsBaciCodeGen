# Characteristic Component Code Generation

Code generation prototipe for ACS (Alma Common Software) monitoring points implementation and deployment using EMF and Acceleo.

## Getting Started

The generation is done by creating an instance of the ecore metamodel. This can be done by running the generated editor project as an eclipse plugin. Then the Acceleo project must be configured and run, and the implementation file must be completed.

### Prerequisites

The projects were created in Eclipse 4.6. EMF, and Acceleo must be installed.
